			<p>
				Forged in the heart of the Umbral Forge, the <em>Shadowsteel Sword</em> is a longsword infused with dark energies that draw strength from shadows. The blade absorbs ambient light, dimming its surroundings when drawn.
			</p>
			<p class="indent">
				The <em>Shadowsteel Sword</em> is a magic, sentient weapon that grants a +2 bonus to attack and damage rolls made with it. When attacking a creature in dim light or darkness, the sword deals an additional 2d8 necrotic damage.
			</p>
			<p class="indent">While the sword is on your person, you gain darkvision out to a range of 60 feet. If you already have darkvision, the range increases by 30 feet.</p>
			<p class="indent">
				Once per long rest, as an action, you can cast <i>shadow blade</i> (save DC 16) from the sword. The sword regains the ability to cast this spell at the next dawn.
			</p>
			<p class="indent">
				<i>
					<b>Sentience.</b>
				</i> The <em>Shadowsteel Sword</em> is a sentient neutral evil weapon with an Intelligence of 12, a Wisdom of 14, and a Charisma of 18. It has darkvision out to a range of 120 feet and can communicate telepathically with its wielder.
			</p>
			<p class="indent">
				<i>
					<b>Personality.</b>
				</i> The sword seeks to be wielded by those who walk in the shadows and thrive in the darkness. It encourages its wielder to shun the light and embrace the night, whispering temptations to seek power in darkness.

		<description>
			<p>
				Forged by expert dwarven craftsmen, the Crossbow of the Manticore is a deadly weapon fashioned from the remains of a slain manticore. 
				Its frame is reinforced with manticore bones and sinew, and the bolts are enchanted to mimic the creature’s fearsome spiked tail. 
				A small but fierce aura of predatory magic radiates from it, granting the wielder a taste of the manticore’s fierce power.
			</p>
			<p class="indent">
				<em>Manticore's Fury:</em> When you make a ranged attack with this crossbow, you can activate the Manticore’s Fury ability. 
				You may expend one of three charges to unleash a flurry of spectral spikes alongside the bolt. 
				If the attack hits, it deals an additional 2d6 piercing damage, as ghostly spines strike the target.
			</p>
			<p class="indent">The crossbow regains 1d3 expended charges daily at dawn.</p>
