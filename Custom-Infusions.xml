				<em>Item: An article of clothing or footwear - not armour.</em>
			</p>
			<p>
				Using this infusion, your clothing detects and stores an imprint of the wearer's most common movement patterns, and then attempts to replicate them.
				This applies to all rolls that include a dexterity modifier and to damage rolls from spells without a verbal component.
				<br/>
				Whenever the wearer rolls the minimum or maximum value on a die for one of these rolls, they must reroll that die and use the new value with an additional +1 bonus.
