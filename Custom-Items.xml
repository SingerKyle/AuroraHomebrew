			<p>This small, weathered stone is intricately etched with the distinctive insignia of the Rockseeker Clan, depicting a pickaxe and a mountain, intertwined in a pattern that symbolises the clan's deep bond with the earth. 
			The stone’s surface feels surprisingly warm to the touch, as if imbued with the clan’s ancient energy.</p>

			<p>When you possess a Rockseeker Clan Token, it marks you as an ally of the Rockseeker Clan, granting you the following benefits:</p>

			<p>- **Clan Recognition:** Members of the Rockseeker Clan recognise you immediately as a friend or trusted associate. 
			This grants you advantage on Charisma (Persuasion) checks when interacting with any member of the clan, and they will generally be more willing to offer aid or information when asked.</p>
