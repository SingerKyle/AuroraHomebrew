				This weathered quarterstaff appears to be an ordinary piece of driftwood, its surface smoothed by years of ocean currents.
				However, upon closer inspection, faint carvings of waves and spiraling patterns run along its length,
				glowing softly with a pale blue light when exposed to moonlight or water.
				The staff exudes a calming presence, as if imbued with the rhythm of the tides.

			<br/>
			<p>This staff can cast <em>Create / Destroy Water</em> once per day, and allows for the casting of <em>Control Water</em>.</p>
