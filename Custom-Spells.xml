			<p>You summon a small void rift in your palm, siphoning energy from a magical source or creature. The target must make a Constitution saving throw or lose a spell slot (chosen at random). You regain hit points equal to twice the slot’s level..</p>
			<!--<p class="indent">The transformation lasts for the duration, or until the target drops to 0 hit points or dies. The new form can be any beast of CR 1 or less that does not have a fly speed. While in this new form, the target is charmed by you and views you as a trusted ally. The target can understand simple commands such as “attack” or “stay.” The charm affects creatures that are immune to charm in their normal form. The charm ends immediately when the target reverts to its normal form.</p>
			<p class="indent">The target’s game statistics, including mental ability scores, are replaced by the statistics of the chosen beast. It retains its alignment and personality. The creature is limited in the actions it can perform by the nature of its new form, and it can’t speak, cast spells, or take any other action that requires hands or speech. The creature's gear melds into its new form. The creature can’t activate, use, wield, or otherwise benefit from any of its equipment.</p>
			<p class="indent">The target assumes the hit points of its new form. When it reverts to its normal form, the creature returns to the number of hit points it had before it transformed. If it reverts as a result of dropping to 0 hit points, any excess damage carries over to its normal form.</p> -->
