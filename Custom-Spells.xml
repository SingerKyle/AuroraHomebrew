			<p>This spell creates a temporary quasi-real workshop in a 10’x10’ area. Choose a type of artisan’s tools, a workshop containing those tools and its associated gear appears.</p>
			<p>For example, choosing Smith’s Tools would cause quasi-real hammers, tongs, pliers to appear along with an anvil, forge, fuel and bellows. 
				A person who is proficient with the chosen tools can use this phantom workshop as effectively as a real workshop.</p>
			
			<p class = "indent">
				Any of the equipment or materials created by the spell vanishes in a puff of smoke if it is carried outside the area or when the spell ends. 
				Therefore, it’s necessary to provide real raw materials to create anything that lasts after the spell ends.</p>

				Created by <em>Upper Arcanist Malazar</em> to counteract fireball spells during the Crown Wars.
				Upon casting, an icy streak flashes from your pointing finger to a point you choose within range then blossoms with a crystalline crackle into an explosion of ice. 
				Each creature in a 20-foot radius sphere centered on that point must make a Dexterity saving throw. 
				A target takes 8d6 cold damage on a failed save, or half as much damage on a successful one.

		<description>
			<p>A spell few would dare to learn, outlawed even to mages of Thay. Dating back to the Netherese Empire. A spell created by the late Archmage Malazar </p>
			
			<p>You summon a small void rift in your palm, siphoning energy from a magical source or creature. The target must make a Constitution saving throw or lose a spell slot (chosen at random). You regain hit points equal to twice the slot’s level..</p>
			<!--<p class="indent">The transformation lasts for the duration, or until the target drops to 0 hit points or dies. The new form can be any beast of CR 1 or less that does not have a fly speed. While in this new form, the target is charmed by you and views you as a trusted ally. The target can understand simple commands such as “attack” or “stay.” The charm affects creatures that are immune to charm in their normal form. The charm ends immediately when the target reverts to its normal form.</p>
			<p class="indent">The target’s game statistics, including mental ability scores, are replaced by the statistics of the chosen beast. It retains its alignment and personality. The creature is limited in the actions it can perform by the nature of its new form, and it can’t speak, cast spells, or take any other action that requires hands or speech. The creature's gear melds into its new form. The creature can’t activate, use, wield, or otherwise benefit from any of its equipment.</p>
			<p class="indent">The target assumes the hit points of its new form. When it reverts to its normal form, the creature returns to the number of hit points it had before it transformed. If it reverts as a result of dropping to 0 hit points, any excess damage carries over to its normal form.</p> -->

		<supports>Wizard, Sorcerer</supports>
		<description>
			<p>
				You create an immobile dome of protective force with a radius of 10 feet around and above you and remains stationary for the duration. The dome has 30 hit points. You choose any number of creatures when you cast this spell so they can move through it. 
				All other creatures are barred from passing through it.
			</p>
			
			<p>
				When a creature outside of the dome targets another creature inside, they target the dome instead. Whenever a creature inside the dome takes damage from another creature from outside, the dome takes the damage instead.
				If this damage reduces the dome to 0 hit points, the creature takes any remaining damage and the dome is destroyed. The dome only takes damage once from spells with an area of effect. The dome disappears after 1 minute passes or it reaches 0 HP.
			</p>
			
			<p><strong>At Higher Levels.</strong> When you cast this spell using a spell slot of 4th level or higher, the Hit points of the dome increases by 10 for each slot level above 3rd.</p>
