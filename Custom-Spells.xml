				This spell creates a temporary quasi-real workshop in a 10’x10’ area. Choose a type of artisan’s tools, a workshop containing those tools and its associated gear appears.
			</p>
			
			<p>
				For example, choosing Smith’s Tools would cause quasi-real hammers, tongs, pliers to appear along with an anvil, forge, fuel and bellows. 
				A person who is proficient with the chosen tools can use this phantom workshop as effectively as a real workshop.
			</p>
			
			<p>
				Any of the equipment or materials created by the spell vanishes in a puff of smoke if it is carried outside the area or when the spell ends. 
				Therefore, it’s necessary to provide real raw materials to create anything that lasts after the spell ends.

				When a creature outside of the dome targets another creature inside, they target the dome instead. Whenever a creature inside the dome takes damage from another creature from outside, the dome takes the damage instead.
				If this damage reduces the dome to 0 hit points, the creature takes any remaining damage and the dome is destroyed. The dome only takes damage once from spells with an area of effect. The dome disappears after 1 minute passes or it reaches 0 HP.
			</p>
			
			<p><strong>At Higher Levels.</strong> When you cast this spell using a spell slot of 4th level or higher, the Hit points of the dome increases by 10 for each slot level above 3rd.</p>

				Derived from the unstable energy experiments of <em>Archmage Malazar</em>, this spell was originally a Netherese weapon of war. 
				Malazar sought to fuse opposing elemental forces, fire and lightning, into a single volatile magic. 
				Though the Empire fell, remnants of his research persisted in arcane circles, warning of its destructive power.
