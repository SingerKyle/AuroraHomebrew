				This solid steel mechanical prosthetic, once attached to a functional prosthetic base, allows the user the same range of motion and functionality of the arm or leg it is replacing.
				The lack of sensory feedback from the limb, however, can make some tasks more difficult than normal.
				<br/>
				Add +2 to any Strength saving throws and Athletics checks made using this limb. Additionally, if you do not benefit from the Martial Arts feature of the Monk class,
				add +2 to the damage of any unarmed strikes made using this limb.
				<br/>
				Sleight of Hand checks and skill checks requiring fine motor control made using this limb have a -2 penalty.

		<description>
			<p>
				This prosthetic functions much like a standard mechanical limb, but is made of a lighter, more expensive alloy that is resistant to temperature changes. 
				As a result, this prosthetic no longer suffers from the ill effects of cold environments as described in the Practical Concerns section of this document.
				<br/>
				Add +1 to any Strength saving throws and Athletics checks made using this limb. 
				Additionally, if you do not benefit from the Martial Arts feature of the Monk class, add +1 to the damage of any unarmed strikes made using this limb.
				<br/>
				Sleight of Hand checks and skill checks requiring fine motor control made using this limb have a -2 penalty.

		<description>
			<p>
				The chassis of this artificial limb is made of rare and expensive alloys that shield the prosthetic base from magical influence, allowing the limb to continue functioning, even while under the effects of spells such as Antimagic Field.
				<br/>
				Add +1 to any Strength saving throws and Athletics checks made using this limb. Additionally, if you do not benefit from the Martial Arts feature of the Monk class, add +1 to the damage of any unarmed strikes made using this limb.
				<br/>
				Sleight of Hand checks and skill checks requiring fine motor control made using this limb have a -2 penalty.
				<br/>
				Additionally, magical effects directly targeting the chassis of this limb (such as Mend) fizzle out and do nothing.

		<description>
			<p>
				This artificial limb is much less bulky than its counterparts and its frame more closely follows the contours of an organic limb. 
				The interior of its chassis is lined with copper, precious metals, and complex arcane engravings. 
				A powerful enchantment provides full sensory feedback to its user, allowing all sorts of tasks to be accomplished with the limb.
				<br/>
				Add +1 to any Strength saving throws and Athletics checks made using this limb. 
				Additionally, if you do not benefit from the Martial Arts feature of the Monk class, add +1 to the damage of any unarmed strikes made using this limb.

			<p>
				While it may be unpleasant to look at and eerily cold to the touch, the viscous slime coating this prosthesis won’t harm you. Unless you can cast spells, that is. Then it will. Horribly.
			</p>

			<p>
				This item replaces a lost arm. While the prosthetic is attached, it functions identically to the part it replaces.
				You can detach or reattach it as an action, and it can’t be removed against your will. It detaches if you die.
			</p>

			<p>
				As a bonus action, you can cause this prosthesis to emit dim light in a <strong>10-foot radius</strong> or extinguish the light.
			</p>

			<p>
				<strong>Prosthesis Properties.</strong> This prosthesis can enhance or replace an arm. It has the Melee (1d6 slashing, Pugilist) property and the Hamstring Superior Strike.
			</p>

			<p>
				<strong>Arcanovore.</strong>
				You have <strong>advantage</strong> on ability checks made to grapple creatures capable of casting one or more spells using this prosthesis, and while grappling one, you can use an action to drain some of its magical power.
				The creature loses a 1st-level spell slot, or it loses one daily use of a random 1st-level spell. This magic is stored in the prosthesis, and while it contains stored magic, it can’t be used to drain more.
				As an action while the prosthesis contains stored magic, you can touch a creature with it and expend the stored magic, causing the creature to regain an expended spell slot of equal level to the spell slot or spell that was stored within.
				Once this property has been used, roll a <strong>d6</strong>. On a roll of <strong>2</strong> or lower, it can’t be used again until the next dawn.
			</p>

			<p>
				<strong>Greatsword (2d6, Property +1).</strong> The prosthesis is a martial melee weapon.
				If you’re proficient with a martial melee weapon, you’re considered proficient with this weapon.
				The information in parentheses notes the weapon’s damage dice, damage type, and any additional weapon properties it may have, respectively.
			</p>

			<p>
				<strong>Pugilist.</strong> For creatures that roll a die when they make unarmed strikes (such as the monk),
				the size of their damage die is increased by one (maximum 1d12) when they make unarmed strikes with a hand equipped with a weapon that has this property.

			<p>
				Requires an elemental core of air to be crafted.
				<br/>
				“Eagles soar above Where no man could ever reach Good thing I’m no man.”
				<br/>
				Haiku written by Bombuku the tanukin during the crafting of the first windweaver
				<br/>
				This prosthesis has a built-in war fan that can be used to propel yourself with blasts of magical wind. It has the Integrated (tessen) and Blast (2d6 bludgeoning, 30 ft.) properties.
				<br/>
				Stick the Landing. When you fall, you can use your reaction to unleash a blast of wind moments before you hit the ground, cushioning you and reducing the falling damage you take to 0.

		<description>
			<p>
				This prosthetic appendage was developed by a mysterious Puppeteer. The painted patterns on its surface vary from an individual to another. 
				To attune to this item, you must attach it to your arm at the wrist, elbow, or shoulder, at which point the ceramic plating will magically extend and form a copy of the appendage it’s replacing.
			</p>
				<br/>
			<p>
				The prosthetic is a fully capable part of your body, You can take an action to remove the prosthetic, and it removes itself if your attunement to it ends. It can’t be removed against your will.
			</p>
				<br/>
			<p>
				When performing unarmed strikes, the ceramic plating on the side of your hand suddenly becomes sharp and thin. You deal 1d6 magical slashing damage.
			</p>
				<br/>
			<p>
				<strong>Full plating.</strong> As an action you can say the command word to activate the ceramic plating, recovering your whole body for 1 minute. You have the appearance of an automated porcelain doll.
				You gain +2 AC and you are still considered unarmored. You are vulnerable to bludgeoning damage and gain resistance to fire and slashing damage. You can use the Prosthetic in this manner again once you complete a short rest.
			</p>

			<p>
				This spectral floating cluster can replace a hand, arm, foot, leg, or similar appendage that was lost or removed. 
				It glows with green and blue hues and looks almost intangible. Despite its appearance, the phantom limb cannot phase through any material or creature. 
				While the phantom limb is attached and attuned to you, it functions identically to the body part it is replacing. You can make it appear or disappear at will as a free action.
			</p>
			<br/>
			<p>
				If you have multiple prosthetic limbs, they count as a single magic item with regard to the number of magic items you can attune to.
			</p>
			<br/>
			<p>
				Your phantom limb has a reach of 10.ft when making unarmed strikes or attacks with a weapon with the light property.
			</p>
			<br/>
			<p>
				As an action, you can detach your limb. When your limb is detached it acts as described by the spell mage hand. You can use an action to reattach your limb as long as it is within 30 feet of you.
			</p>
