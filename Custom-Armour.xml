			<p>
				The <em>Radiant-Infused Shield</em> is a magical shield blessed by celestial beings. The shield's surface glows faintly with divine light, granting protection and healing properties to its wielder.
			</p>
			<p class="indent">You have a +1 bonus to AC while wielding this shield. In addition, the shield has 3 charges and regains 1d3 expended charges daily at dawn.</p>
			<p class="indent">As a reaction when a creature within 5 feet of you takes damage, you can expend 1 charge to grant that creature 2d6 temporary hit points. These hit points last for 1 minute.</p>
			<p class="indent">
				While holding the shield, you can use an action to cast <i>shield of faith</i> (save DC 15) or <i>cure wounds</i> at 1st level. Once either spell is cast, it cannot be cast again from the shield until the next dawn.
			</p>
			<p class="indent">
				<i>
					<b>Personality.</b>
				</i> The shield embodies a strong will to protect the innocent and defend against evil. It urges its wielder to stand as a guardian, protecting others and showing mercy to the helpless.
