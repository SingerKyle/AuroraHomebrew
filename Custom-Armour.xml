		<description>
			<p>
				This magical shield has an animated face carved into it. 
				It may be unreliable piece of armour, but it certainly an encouraging battle companion. 
				Due to the holes in the face of this shield, it only grants a +1 bonus to AC instead of the normal shield bonus.
			</p>
			<p>
				<strong>Grounding Confidence.</strong>While holding <em>Mister Shield</em> you gain a +1 bonus to Wisdom saving throws.
			</p>
			<p>
				<strong>Stalwart Positivity.</strong> When an attack roll misses you while holding <em>Mister Shield</em>,
				you gain Heroic Inspiration. Once triggered, you can't benefit from this property again until you complete a short or long rest.
			</p>
			<p>
				<strong>Sentience.</strong> <em>Mister Shield</em> is a sentient, neutral good shield with an Intelligence of 8, a Wisdom of 10, and a charisma of 16. It can see and hear out to a range of 60 ft.
				The shield can speak, read and understand common. <em>Mister Shield</em> is a jolly and supportive companion who always compliments the bravery of its wielder and cheers when blocking attacks. 
				<em>Mister Shield</em> doesn't like violence, and believes friendship is always the answer.
			</p>
			<p>
				<em>"Ha HA! Nice One!" Mister Shield Exclaimed as the demon's flaming flail bounced off its rim. "Even though we're totally surrounded, your defence is unbreakable!"</em>
				<br/>
				<em>Jesse yelped as a dagger jabbed her arm, "Shut up! Every time you talk, I get stabbed through your friggin mouth hole!"</em>
				<br/>
				<em>With each demon that Jesse defeated, another crawled through the portal to take its place. This was a disaster.</em>

				While wearing this armor you gain a climbing speed equal to your movement speed, you have advantage on Dexterity (Acrobatic) checks,
				and when falling, you glide to an unoccupied space no more than double the distance of the height you fell and take no damage.
				If there isn’t space to land, you collide with an object in range and take the full fall damage.

			<p>
				While holding this massive shield, you have a +1 bonus to AC. This bonus is in addition to the shield’s normal bonus to AC.
			</p>
			<p>
				The shield has 4 charges. As an action, you can expend
				one or more charges to attempt to restrain one target per
				expenditure within 10 feet of you. The target must make a DC 15 Strength saving throw or be restrained. 
				A creature restrained by the chains can use its action to make another saving throw. On a success, it frees itself. If you expend two charges on the same target, the target makes saving throws against the effect with disadvantage
			</p>
			<p>
				The shield regains 1d4 expended charges daily at dawn. If you expend the last charge, roll a d20. On a 1, the shield immediately triggers the power of convergence, requiring you to roll on the convergence table.
