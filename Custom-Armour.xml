			<p>
				The <em>Radiant-Infused Shield</em> is a magical shield blessed by celestial beings. The shield's surface glows faintly with divine light, granting protection and healing properties to its wielder.
			</p>
			<p class="indent">You have a +1 bonus to AC while wielding this shield. In addition, the shield has 3 charges and regains 1d3 expended charges daily at dawn.</p>
			<p class="indent">As a reaction when a creature within 5 feet of you takes damage, you can expend 1 charge to grant that creature 2d6 temporary hit points. These hit points last for 1 minute.</p>
			<p class="indent">
				While holding the shield, you can use an action to cast <i>shield of faith</i> (save DC 15) or <i>cure wounds</i> at 1st level. Once either spell is cast, it cannot be cast again from the shield until the next dawn.
			</p>
			<p class="indent">
				<i>
					<b>Personality.</b>
				</i> The shield embodies a strong will to protect the innocent and defend against evil. It urges its wielder to stand as a guardian, protecting others and showing mercy to the helpless.

				This magical shield has an animated face carved into it. 
				It may be unreliable piece of armour, but it certainly an encouraging battle companion. 
				Due to the holes in the face of this shield, it only grants a +1 bonus to AC instead of the normal shield bonus.
			</p>
			<p>
				<strong>Grounding Confidence.</strong>While holding <em>Mister Shield</em> you gain a +1 bonus to Wisdom saving throws.
			</p>
			<p>
				<strong>Stalwart Positivity.</strong> When an attack roll misses you while holding <em>Mister Shield</em>,
				you gain Heroic Inspiration. Once triggered, you can't benefit from this property again until you complete a short or long rest.
			</p>
			<p>
				<strong>Sentience.</strong> <em>Mister Shield</em> is a sentient, neutral good shield with an Intelligence of 8, a Wisdom of 10, and a charisma of 16. It can see and hear out to a range of 60 ft.
				The shield can speak, read and understand common. <em>Mister Shield</em> is a jolly and supportive companion who always compliments the bravery of its wielder and cheers when blocking attacks. 
				<em>Mister Shield</em> doesn't like violence, and believes friendship is always the answer.
			</p>
			<p>
				<em>"Ha HA! Nice One!" Mister Shield Exclaimed as the demon's flaming flail bounced off its rim. "Even though we're totally surrounded, your defence is unbreakable!"</em>
				<br/>
				<em>Jesse yelped as a dagger jabbed her arm, "Shut up! Every time you talk, I get stabbed through your friggin mouth hole!"</em>
				<br/>
				<em>With each demon that Jesse defeated, another crawled through the portal to take its place. This was a disaster.</em>
