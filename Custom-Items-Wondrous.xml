		<description>
			<p>This small, weathered stone is intricately etched with the distinctive insignia of the Rockseeker Clan, depicting a pickaxe and a mountain, intertwined in a pattern that symbolises the clan's deep bond with the earth. 
			The stone’s surface feels surprisingly warm to the touch, as if imbued with the clan’s ancient energy.</p>

			<p>When you possess a Rockseeker Clan Token, it marks you as an ally of the Rockseeker Clan, granting you the following benefits:</p>

			<p>- <bold>Clan Recognition:</bold>  Members of the Rockseeker Clan recognise you immediately as a friend or trusted associate. 
			This grants you advantage on Charisma (Persuasion) checks when interacting with any member of the clan, and they will generally be more willing to offer aid or information when asked.</p>

	<element name="Used Bag of Holding" type="Magic Item" source="Wardens of Faerûn" id="ID_CUSTOM_WHIZZ_HOLDING_BAG">
		<description>
			<p>This small, weathered bag of holding was previously enchanted by a great magic user. It was broken, seemingly by time and once again reforged by Whizz-Bang Rockseeker inside a lost Netherese crypt.</p>

			<p class="indent">The bag can hold up to 500 pounds, not exceeding a volume of 64 cubic feet. The bag weighs 15 pounds, regardless of its contents. Retrieving an item from the bag requires an action.</p>
			
			<p class="indent">If the bag is overloaded, pierced, or torn, it ruptures and is destroyed, and its contents are scattered in the Astral Plane. 
				If the bag is turned inside out, its contents spill forth, unharmed, but the bag must be put right before it can be used again. 
				Breathing creatures inside the bag can survive up to a number of minutes equal to 10 divided by the number of creatures (minimum 1 minute), after which time they begin to suffocate.</p>

			<p class="indent">Placing a bag of holding inside an extradimensional space created by a handy haversack, portable hole, or similar item instantly destroys both items and opens a gate to the Astral Plane. 
				The gate originates where the one item was placed inside the other. Any creature within 10 feet of the gate is sucked through it to a random location on the Astral Plane. 
				The gate then closes. The gate is one-way only and can't be reopened.</p>
